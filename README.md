Project Overview
----------------
This project involves writing a C function that reads and returns the next line from a given file descriptor (fd). The main objective is to create a reusable function that simplifies reading lines from files or standard input. This project will also introduce and deepen understanding of static variables in C programming, a crucial concept for maintaining state between function calls.
